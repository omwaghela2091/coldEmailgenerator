These are unique operations roles centered around driving future ways of working for our CPBM community.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0WHO WE ARE LOOKING FOR\\u202f\\xa0Our CPBM Operations team is looking for creative, solution-focused thinkers, who know how to bring a project to life and execute their vision. Being a self-starter is very important, as the projects can offer a lot of ambiguity. It is important that you are willing to ask questions, gather & accept feedback, and seek help when needed.\\xa0Leading with a digital mindset, you will engage the Global CPBM community on critical initiatives and projects on behalf of CPBM to bring our growth strategies to life.\\u202f\\xa0Qualifications:\\xa0Enrolled in an MBA program with an expected graduation date of December 2025 or Spring 2026\\xa0Background\\u202fin Business, Information Science or related field preferred\\u202f\\xa03-5 years work experience\\xa0Resume submission (PDF) and Cover Letter required for consideration\\u202f\\xa0\\xa0Skills:\\xa0Proven ability to partner on cross-functional teams supporting large scale change across an organization\\xa0Passionate about processes potential for improving planning, execution, and work/life balance\\xa0Excellent problem structuring and strategic problem-solving skills\\xa0Compelling, high-impact storyteller with the ability to influence at multiple levels throughout the organization\\xa0Self-directed and comfortable working in ambiguous environments\\xa0Knowledge of product creation, design thinking and merchandising strongly preferred\\u202f\\xa0Strong experience with digital tools and demonstrated digital approach\\xa0Passionate about Nike brand, products and consumers\\u202f\\xa0\\xa0WHAT YOU’LL WORK ON\\xa0As a part of the CPBM Operations team, you will work on projects that focus on accountability and consistency of process, tools, results, and communication across an entire function, with a focus on simplification. You will have a close connection to process & partners across multiple business units, product engines, and functions. You will need to be curious and proactive in learning about the organization, as well as finding opportunities to share your knowledge. You will need to collect and understand requirements from partners to craft and support the most efficient ways to work, inclusive of scaling best practices. You will work in ambiguous, highly collaborative environments, and bring creative and analytical thinking to the solutions you build. Example projects may include:\\xa0Identify three key business use cases in Product Merchandising. Then, maximizing the source of truth POS data set, demonstrate the feasibility and any advantages of using Chata AI to quickly and accurately answer business questions.\\xa0Integrating business reporting and data into the decision-making process and improving the way we are capturing and flagging information to better align to business goals.\\xa0Color is one of our biggest issues at Nike, showing up as non-adoption/volatility and wasted time by teams. This project will require you to clearly define the process and tool for Apparel and Footwear teams to use for color briefing. This process needs to take into account what is happening upstream and downstream of this work as well as seasonal overlap. It also needs to take into account color design capacity for how many colors the team can actually create.\\xa0\\xa0This is a paid internship opportunity with relocation assistance.
